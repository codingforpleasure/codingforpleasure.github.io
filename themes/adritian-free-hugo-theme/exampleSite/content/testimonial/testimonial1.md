Gil is an excellent teacherâ€”thorough, patient, and capable of solving any problem! He is highly professional, yet also considerate and caring. Gil helped me immensely in a graduate-level course on social networks, which required a deep understanding of social network analysis as well as Python coding. He is undoubtedly talented and experienced! I highly recommend him!
