      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gil is an excellent teacher—thorough, patient, and capable of solving any problem! He is highly professional, yet also considerate and caring. Gil helped me immensely in a graduate-level course on social networks, which required a deep understanding of social network analysis as well as Python coding. He is undoubtedly talented and experienced! I highly recommend him!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
