Gil is a skilled and efficient mentor. After an initial needs assessment, he created a personalized and goal-oriented lesson plan to quickly get me up to speed. Beyond his teaching expertise, he demonstrated an extraordinary passion for teaching. His meticulous attention to coding and styling rules, emphasis on the proper use of complementary tools in the work environment, and his effort to provide supplementary knowledge for a broader perspective on the subject all stood out. This was delivered with patience and humor. In summary, every session with Gil is a rich, enjoyable, and highly informative experience.
