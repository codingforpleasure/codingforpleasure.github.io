Professional, patient, and courteousâ€”these are the words that describe Gil. I study bioinformatics, and Gil helped me with a very challenging exercise in R. He provided clear explanations for every line of code he wrote and ensured I understood everything without any confusion. In the end, he delivered a well-organized and elegant solution. Highly recommended!
