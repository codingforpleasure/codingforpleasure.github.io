Gil helped us execute a data science project in Python and build a machine learning model. We ultimately achieved a very high-level final result, thanks to Gil's dedication. He always came prepared for lessons and invested his free time to address issues that could have "stalled" the sessions. This allowed us to complete the project in a short amount of time. Highly recommended!
