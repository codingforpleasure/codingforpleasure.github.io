Gil is an absolutely amazing teacher. He helped me with a difficult programming assignment that I was completely stuck on, and thanks to his help, I got a 100. He is very professional and highly skilled in the subject matter. He explains everything very clearly, which allowed me to progress quickly in my studies. Highly recommended teacher!
