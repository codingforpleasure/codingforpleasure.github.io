      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gil is a skilled and efficient mentor. After an initial needs assessment, he created a personalized and goal-oriented lesson plan to quickly get me up to speed. Beyond his teaching expertise, he demonstrated an extraordinary passion for teaching. His meticulous attention to coding and styling rules, emphasis on the proper use of complementary tools in the work environment, and his effort to provide supplementary knowledge for a broader perspective on the subject all stood out. This was delivered with patience and humor. In summary, every session with Gil is a rich, enjoyable, and highly informative experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gil helped us execute a data science project in Python and build a machine learning model. We ultimately achieved a very high-level final result, thanks to Gil&amp;rsquo;s dedication. He always came prepared for lessons and invested his free time to address issues that could have &amp;ldquo;stalled&amp;rdquo; the sessions. This allowed us to complete the project in a short amount of time. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Professional, patient, and courteous—these are the words that describe Gil. I study bioinformatics, and Gil helped me with a very challenging exercise in R. He provided clear explanations for every line of code he wrote and ensured I understood everything without any confusion. In the end, he delivered a well-organized and elegant solution. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gil is an excellent teacher—thorough, patient, and capable of solving any problem! He is highly professional, yet also considerate and caring. Gil helped me immensely in a graduate-level course on social networks, which required a deep understanding of social network analysis as well as Python coding. He is undoubtedly talented and experienced! I highly recommend him!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
